===============
First I use the shell command to create a frequency table from the 15th column of each csv file.  I could not get the csv files to load on my computer, so I used the bunzip command, which I believe worked, until year 2002 at least. In year 2002, there was the error 'Illegal byte sequence.' I couldn't get the sed package to install on my computer because I was using our departmental computers which don't allow for us to install anything.  So my estimates for mean, median and standard deviation are only for the years 1987-2002.  

After running the shell command which creates the document 'freq.txt', I run the R code which uses loops to create the mean, median and standard deviation. I realize this is not the most efficient way to calculate them, so I will try to improve on these methods before submitting next Thursday. 

The run time statistics as well as the results are stored in an object called, 'bshaull_assign1.rda."
I got a mean of 7.076252, median of 3 and standard deviation of 27.116784.
